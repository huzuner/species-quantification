# Snakemake workflow: Tumor-microbiome-calling

A Snakemake workflow for quantification of species in a sequencing sample, using [https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2] and [https://github.com/jenniferlu717/Bracken]. Optionally, it also offers to do benchmarking of Illumina and ONT samples that are generated to contain human + desired bacterial species.

The required configuration of these usages can be seen in `config/README.md`.
